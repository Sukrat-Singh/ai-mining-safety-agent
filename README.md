A Retrieval-Augmented AI system that extracts, structures, indexes, and analyzes mining accident data from official DGMS mining safety reports. Supports conversational querying — fully offline, no API credits required.

This is a **production-style RAG pipeline**, not a demo chatbot.
Built for an **AI Hackathon** — solving real industrial safety problems in mining using RAG + Local LLMs

### 🔧 Additional Module: Streamlit Safety Intelligence UI
**A Streamlit + NLP-based Mining Safety Intelligence System**
**Located in `/secondary_model`**

## 📌 Overview

This project:

| Function          | Description                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 📄 PDF Ingestion   | Reads DGMS accident reports                      |
| 🧾 Data Extraction | Converts text → structured records               |
| 💽 Storage         | Saves structured data as Parquet                 |
| 🔎 Vector Index    | Embeds accidents & stores in ChromaDB            |
| 🧠 AI Agent        | Answers mining safety questions conversationally |

### Sample Questions

```
Which mines in Rajasthan had fatal accidents in 2015?
What caused the accident at Khetri Copper Complex?
How many miners died due to roof fall incidents?
```

---

## 🧠 Architecture

- PDF ➜ text ➜ structured records (Pandas)
- Parquet storage
- Sentence-Transformers embeddings (local)
- Chroma vector DB
- Local LLM via **Ollama** (Llama-3 or Mistral)
- LangChain Runnable pipeline

> Fully local: **no OpenAI required after setup**

## ⚙️ Setup

### Clone repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ai-mining-safety-agent
cd ai-mining-safety-agent
```

### Create virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\\Scripts\\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 📥 1) Ingest PDF

Place PDF in `data/raw/`  
Then run:

```bash
python -m scripts.01_ingest
```

---

## 🧾 2) Extract Structured Records

```bash
python -m scripts.02_extract
```

---

## 🧠 3) Build Vector Index

```bash
python -m scripts.03_build_index
```

---

## 💬 4) Run Chat Assistant

### Install & start Ollama
(Windows download: https://ollama.com/download/windows)

```bash
ollama pull llama3     # or `mistral`
ollama serve           # keep this running
```

### Launch agent

```bash
python -m scripts.04_chat_cli
```

---

## ✅ Example Output

```
You: Which mines in Rajasthan had fatal accidents?

Assistant:
Fatal accidents were reported in Khetri Copper Complex and Kolihan Mine in Rajasthan.
```
